<h1>CSS Modified Website</h1>
    <p>Hello World. Welcome to my first website that is made, and now modified, from scratch. It is a pleasure to meet you.</p>
<h2 class="about-head">About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Taylor Stanley Ross Young, I am 23 and a student at the University of Ottawa in the Digital Journalism program.</p>
    <p>I have made websites before, but they were created from templates which I then modified using HTML and CSS. While I have played around on my own time with making websites from scratch, using notepad, I have never made live any of my work.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include reading, writing, listening to music, playing video games with my friends, and playing the bagpipes.</p>

          <figcaption>One evening a couple years ago I was out walking, and enjoying a nice refreshing alcoholic beverage after a long day of working, and I came across a calf that had been separated from the rest of the herd. I calmed it down with some pets and scrates and then took it back to it's mother.</figcaption>

    <h2>My Career as a Competative Musician</h2>
      <p>I have been playing the bagpipes since I was about eight years old. I joined the Glengarry Pipe Band after a couple years attending the Glengarry School of Piping and Drumming, and have been with them ever since. As a band we have travelled to many places all over Ontario, Canada's eastern coast, the United States, and even Scotland. In 2013 we were awarded sixth place in the World Pipe Band Championships; held in Glasgow, Scotland, making us the 6th best pipe band in the world in our division for that year. I also compete in solo competitions and have won numerous awards over the years. </p>
      <p>With COVID-19 we were unable to compete this summer season, but managed to still get togther after restrictions lifted to allow more people to gather. We even managed to do a live recording to contribute to the virtual Glengarry Highland Games, which was used as a substitute to the annual event. That was the only opportunity all three of our bands had to get together and perform; albeit with restrictions to social distancing.</p>
